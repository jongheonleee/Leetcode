        1. The ZERO comes from 10.
        2. The 10 comes from 2 x 5
        3. And we need to account for all the products of 5 and 2. likes 4Ã—5 = 20 ...
        4. So, if we take all the numbers with 5 as a factor, we'll have way more than enough even numbers to pair with them to get factors of 10
